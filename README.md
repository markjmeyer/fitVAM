# fitVAM
Methods for estimating variational additive models with an arbitrary number of smoothed semiparametric and functional effects using a mean field variational Bayesian approximation and a coordinate ascent 
variational inference algorithm. Other tools include a testing procedure that relies on a frequentist test for semiparametric effects. The method is described by [Meyer (2024)]([https://arxiv.org/abs/](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08168)).
