Description: Methods for estimating variational additive models with an arbitrary number of smoothed semiparametric and 
    functional effects using a mean field variational Bayesian approximation and a coordinate ascent variational inference (CAVI)
    algorithm. Other tools include a testing procedure that relies on a frequentist test for semiparametric effects.
